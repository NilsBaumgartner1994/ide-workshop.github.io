# Welcome!

Despite the research community’s desire to improve the productivity of software developers, it is challenging for research to move beyond papers into the everyday practice of software development. Since IDEs are one of the most widely used tools in developers’ toolkit, they are one of the main venues for research to reach software developers. To close the gap between research and adoption in practice, we are launching the first edition of the IDE workshop. At our workshop we will equip researchers with the practical insights they need to successfully deploy their research through IDE plugins and connect them with IDE builders that share insights and best practices, and show previews of undocumented or upcoming IDE features. Join us to learn from evidence-based best practices that colleagues in academia follow when deploying their research as IDE plugins. We invite you to share your perspective and help us identify entry-barriers and promising ideas from the research community so that IDE builders can make informed decisions on how their IDEs could best serve the research and developers community. Join a community of researchers and IDE builders that are committed to go the extra mile to move research into practice. Together we go farther.
