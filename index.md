# Welcome!

{% include figure.html img="title.jpg" alt="title card" width="100%" %}

Despite the research community’s desire to improve the productivity of software developers, it is challenging for research to move beyond papers into the everyday practice of software development. Since IDEs are one of the most widely used tools in developers’ toolkit, they are one of the main venues for research to reach software developers. To close the gap between research and adoption in practice, we are launching the first edition of the IDE workshop. At our workshop we will equip researchers with the practical insights they need to successfully deploy their research through IDE plugins and connect them with IDE builders that share insights and best practices, and show previews of undocumented or upcoming IDE features. Join us to learn from evidence-based best practices that colleagues in academia follow when deploying their research as IDE plugins. We invite you to share your perspective and help us identify entry-barriers and promising ideas from the research community so that IDE builders can make informed decisions on how their IDEs could best serve the research and developers community. Join a community of researchers and IDE builders that are committed to go the extra mile to move research into practice. Together we go farther.

## Call for papers

The absence of established best practices in deploying the results of Software Engineering (SE) researchers as IDE plugins leads to a decrease in the number of innovative ideas from Research integrated into IDEs (e.g., differential debugging, continuous profiling, automated program repair). Moreover, there is also no community or place where researchers and IDE developers could rub shoulders and share insights about the current state of the IDEs, their advantages and limitations as a deployment platform, as well as how to go the extra mile to move the results of the research into practice. To overcome this, we are launching this **IDE workshop** dedicated to helping SE research improve IDEs and helping IDEs improve the research. Target audience includes **both researchers and IDE developers**.

**From the research side**, we welcome any contributions that relate to IDEs, in the form of short research papers (up to 4 pages) or even shorter position papers (1–2 pages). The topics include, but are definitely not limited to:

* The development of plugins, add-ons, and extensions for IDEs.
* Integrating prototypes or machine learning models into the IDEs.
* Improving various IDE features, such as automated refactorings, quick fixes, etc.
* Program analysis and static analysis inside the IDE.
* UI/UX studies of working in the IDE, analyzing the way people use IDEs, their workflow, activities, attention, eye movement, etc.
* Visualizations in the IDEs.
* Using IDE as a way of collecting data: e.g., logs, datasets of interactions.
* And others!

However, we also welcome any stories about why a certain tool or approach **was not implemented in the IDE** (e.g., a CLI tool), what the blockers were, and how the IDEs can improve to become more convenient for prototyping.

**From the industry side**, we would like to hear from the developers of IDEs — what exactly they are looking for in research, how they try to incorporate it, what researchers can do to increase the chance of integration into the existing IDEs, etc. Similarly, we are open to the developers of other industrial solutions that operate outside IDEs (e.g., as standalone services) to understand what precludes tighter integration with the rest of the DevTooling. If you are interested in simplifying the deployment of research outcomes as IDE plugins, have an idea on improving the IDEs that needs research, or are simply curious about the latest advancements in software engineering research, come join us in meeting the users & fellow developers, and help create a sense of community of IDE providers that genuinely care!

We want to foster an inclusive community that is welcoming not only established academic researchers but also industry participants (e.g., IDE developers) who might not be familiar with writing scientific papers. Thus, we expect that IDE builders will contribute short position papers (1–2 pages). Even more, they can be submitted in free form, if needed, and we ourselves can help with their formatting. We plan to invite our colleagues — developers and project managers of several IDEs (IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code, etc), and foster a fruitful discussion that can result in practical collaborations. Please join us, share your perspective, and take part in growing the community that cares about practical impact and improving the lives of software developers!
